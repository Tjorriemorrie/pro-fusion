 
MySQL and PHP
Given the info in the attachment source_cdr.sql:
        1. Create a stored function/procedure to retrieve the data and store on a table in separate database (table create info in: dest_table.sql)
        2. Create a php CLI script to do the same where the source and destination servers are not the same host.
	2.1. A progress report needs to be shown as data is transferred, as well as the total transfer time taken up once completed.
	2.2. If the process is cancelled or fails for any other reason identify a unique field on destination_cdr to prevent duplication. The import script can use the cdr_id field on source_cdr table to check which cdr's have been moved and which still need to be moved.
        3. Create an audit log for the destination table in dest_table.sql on a table called cdr_log;
	3.1. Update the code from item 2 to save the data in the new audit log table.

Once completed, please sent all code and database dumps please.
